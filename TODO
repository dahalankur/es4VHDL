hi

- MODIFY setup script to fix permissions if the .es4 folder already exists
- make sure build saves config file
- install yosys (ask mike bauer to install it from https://github.com/YosysHQ/fpga-toolchain/releases/tag/nightly-20211006)
- setenv GHDL_PREFIX fpga-toolchain/lib/ghdl/ !!! THIS NEEDS TO BE THERE! TODO: set this env in the process before running it so explicit setting is not required
- maybe npm install netlistsvg too


-> show filename at the top of the editor, and like vscode, a circle appears if the file has NOT been saved after an edit. if it has, it disappears. note that cmd S works to save now!!
-> flash messages appearing (OR create our own flashing system)
-> fix reload issue! New project should automatically add to the DOM.
-> Compile code 
-> Synthesize a project
-> netlist viewer (new tab?)
-> Format the output window for errors (Scrollable, unintrusive when no errors)
-> Warning when switching files (did you save?)
-> indicate where the new file/dir is being created (like vscode)
    -> -> New file button
       -> New folder button
    -> Correlate between current location, and the files (a lot of these need this to be solved.)
-> Download the bitstream to device


// Not important (TODO later)
-> Choose colors for the background
-> Make the file tree pretty
-> UX improvements
-> Save files to local computer (download full tree, later task. ZIP file)
- make svg viewer zoomable
