- MODIFY setup script to fix permissions if the .es4 folder already exists
- install yosys (ask mike bauer to install it from https://github.com/YosysHQ/fpga-toolchain/releases/tag/nightly-20211006)

- I received an error while trying to create a file (on the frontend). Backend logs
showed no anomaly, probably just a false positive from the frontend. We will be 
changing this anyway.

- show "loading" or some other message when something is being done in the background
- make command + F work to find stuff
- error messages for everything!! build, file/folder creation, pins, etc. etc.!!!
    - config errors => report in output

- FOR BACKUP/SNAPSHOTS: maybe provide a "view version history" option for each file which 
  simply goes to the .snapshot directory and lists all the versions that Halligan has 
  backed up. No effort required from us in terms of implementing the feature.

- Theme (dark, light mode)
- Validate TOML file button attempts to validate current file, regardless of type. (Fix this by checking for .toml extension)
- Validate TOML should be automatically done on project build!

- FRONTEND ERROR HANDLING! Make sure the backend error messages align with what's shown on the frontend and vice-versa.
    - perform_synthesis() --> in build and synthesize_file --> whether or not synthesis was successful
-> Building clearly shows result (success/failure/new files made)

-> flash messages appearing (OR create our own flashing system)
-> fix reload issue! New project should automatically add to the DOM.
-> Format the output window for errors (Scrollable, unintrusive when no errors)
-> Warning when switching files (did you save?)
-> indicate where the new file/dir is being created (like vscode)
    -> -> New file button
       -> New folder button
    -> Correlate between current location, and the files (a lot of these need this to be solved.)
-> Download the bitstream to device

// After deployment, change add_user and give group exec permissions only to es4vhdladmin group

// Not important (TODO later)
-> Choose colors for the background
-> Make the file tree pretty
-> UX improvements
-> Save files to local computer (download full tree, later task. ZIP file)
- make svg viewer zoomable


--- bugs 
-> CONTROL + Z on a new file goes to the old file.
-> New file (duplicate) says "something is wrong"
