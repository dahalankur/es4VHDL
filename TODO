hi

- MODIFY setup script to fix permissions if the .es4 folder already exists
- install yosys (ask mike bauer to install it from https://github.com/YosysHQ/fpga-toolchain/releases/tag/nightly-20211006)

- show "loading" or some other message when something is being done in the background


-> show filename at the top of the editor, and like vscode, a circle appears if the file has NOT been saved after an edit. if it has, it disappears. note that cmd S works to save now!! (todo: improve further on page load)
-> flash messages appearing (OR create our own flashing system)
-> fix reload issue! New project should automatically add to the DOM.
-> Format the output window for errors (Scrollable, unintrusive when no errors)
-> Warning when switching files (did you save?)
-> indicate where the new file/dir is being created (like vscode)
    -> -> New file button
       -> New folder button
    -> Correlate between current location, and the files (a lot of these need this to be solved.)
-> Download the bitstream to device


// Not important (TODO later)
-> Choose colors for the background
-> Make the file tree pretty
-> UX improvements
-> Save files to local computer (download full tree, later task. ZIP file)
- make svg viewer zoomable


--- bugs 
-> CONTROL + Z on a new file goes to the old file.
