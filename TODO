hi

-> show filename at the top of the editor, and like vscode, a circle appears if the file has NOT been saved after an edit. if it has, it disappears. note that cmd S works to save now!!
-> flash messages appearing (OR create our own flashing system)
-> fix reload issue! New project should automatically add to the DOM.
-> Compile code 
-> Synthesize a project
-> netlist viewer (new tab?)
-> Format the output window for errors (Scrollable, unintrusive when no errors)
-> Warning when switching files (did you save?)
-> indicate where the new file/dir is being created (like vscode)
    -> -> New file button
       -> New folder button
    -> Correlate between current location, and the files (a lot of these need this to be solved.)
-> Download the bitstream to device


// Not important (TODO later)
-> Choose colors for the background
-> Make the file tree pretty
-> UX improvements
-> Save files to local computer (download full tree, later task. ZIP file)
