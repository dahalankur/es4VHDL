A prerequisite for being able to use this software is that the user must be in
'es4vhdl' group, and must have run the setup.sh script once to set up all 
relevant directories.

After running the setup.sh script, an .es4 directory should be created in the 
home folder of the student with appropriate group (es4vhdl) and permissions + 
gid bit. 

The webserver also has to be in {es4vhdl,es4vhdl-admin} groups. The students'
files are safe as long as they do not try to create files directly on the server
without using the web UI. This can mess up permissions, preventing the server
from reading the contents of their file. To tackle this, we might provide a 
'fixdir' script that will recursively fix all permissions of the users, starting
at the .es4 directory. To prevent issues like these, students are discouraged
from creating files directly on the vm; they must use the web UI instead.

On the web UI, a create directory button will correspond to 
"mkdir -p $es4_dir/project1 && chmod -R 2775 $es4_dir/project1" command which 
will automatically set the relevant permissions so the web server can read/write
the files in their directories.
